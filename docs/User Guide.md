# Using Drax

If you're a writer who has been pointed towards Drax for some reason, you may be a little bit confused. That's ok! We're here to help. There's just a few things you need to understand or learn before starting, but they're not too bad. 

Drax was made with you in mind. Don't be scared. 


## GitHub
When you create or edit a file in Drax, it uses software called [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to store it in the cloud at a site called [GitHub](https://github.com). 
So to use Drax, you'll first need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). 

Git was originally made for programmers working with computer language files, but it works great with normal text as well. The important thing to remember is that Git saves every version of a document that you've made, so you can always go back and see how it's changed over time. You don't need to worry about losing your work or forgetting that thing you deleted. Every time you press the Save button in Drax, it creates a new version of the document that you can return to any time. (That's why it asks you to write a little note describing your changes: so you can have a record of what you did over time.)

Collections of documents are called "repositories," or "repos" for short. When you use Drax, you first see a list of the repositories that you can access. You can also create a new one, if you want. Note that if you want to create private repositories, you'll need to get a paid account, but the free version works fine otherwise. If you have questions, ask the person who directed you to Drax to help you. 


## Markdown
When you create and edit files in Drax, they are in a format called "Markdown." If you're used to writing in something like Microsoft Word, it takes a little getting used to, but in the long run you'll find that it makes it easier to collaborate and write by streamlining the things you need to worry about. 

Markdown files are plain text files, which means they can be easily created and read by any computer. If you've ever written in Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on the Mac, you'll be familiar with this. In the olden days of the internet, almost everything was plain text, but people found ways to get their points across. They would put stars around words to indicate emphasis, like &#42;this&#42;. They would make sections and headers by putting # characters in front of words or drawing a row of dashes under them. 

Markdown takes these conventions and formalizes them a little bit. This means that while a Markdown file is perfectly readable on its own, it can also be fed into a computer program that makes it into an attractive web page. 

In Markdown you don't have control over things like font size or color; those are for the designer to figure out. You indicate what parts of the text are supposed to mean, and focus on your words. As a writer, it's very freeing to not have to fiddle with getting it to look good.
