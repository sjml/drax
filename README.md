# Drax
Drax is a web-hosted text editor designed for use with GitHub repos and Markdown. It is named for a Bond villain, not the destroyer.

Unlike other online collaboration tools, it only does GitHub, and it only does Markdown. This lets it be more lightweight and streamlined. 

It doesn't do access control or user accounts; GitHub handles all of that. 


## Usage


## Admin
Drax was designed to be easy and cheap to deploy. (It even goes so far as to use the oh-so-unfashionable hash routing to enable this simplicity.) Its [releases](https://github.com/sjml/drax/releases) are boring old directories that can just be thrown on a shared webhost and work with some simple configuration. Check out the [installation docs](./docs/Administration.md#installation) for how to customize a version of Drax for your own usage. 

Repository owners can also do some [configuration](./docs/Administration.md#repository-configuration) to change how any Drax editor will treat the repo.
