# Drax
Drax is a web-hosted text editor designed for use with GitHub repos and Markdown. It is named for a Bond villain, not the destroyer. It was first conceived to work with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). 

Unlike other online collaboration tools, it only does GitHub, and it only does Markdown. This lets it be more lightweight and streamlined. 

It doesn't do access control or user accounts; GitHub handles all of that.
