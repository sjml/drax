# TODO

## Dev
* use actual button styling/logic instead of reproducing it?
    * enable/disable
* figure out if there's a class that goes with the press event

## UI
* let you choose different branches
* put path in location
  * be able to pull from location to set path to repo/dir/file
  * AppRoutingModule?
* fix layout of long directory names (consider tooltip for long names in general?)
  * once we're doing tooltips, show description of repos?

## Bugs
* check if continuation is visible on first load (tall monitor)
* set up a lock so onScroll response can't get double-called

## Polish
* update to use proper GraphQL variables instead of replacing
* surface an error somehow if authorization status is not 'OK'
* make auth URL a configurable parameter (4201)
* give back nothing from graphql query if we're not logged in

## Offline Mode
* cache docs in local storage until they're pushed? 
* recognize when GitHub is unreachable and just let us access the cache
* need to store repository info too... ðŸ˜¬

## Configuration
* hide dotfiles
* only show markdown files?
  * `.markdown`
  * `.mdown`
  * `.mkdn`
  * `.md`
  * `.mkd`
  * `.mdwn`
  * `.mdtxt`
  * `.mdtext`
  * `.text`
  * `.txt`
  * `.Rmd`

## Features
1. Push back changed file with customized message
2. Detect if file in repo has changed since we started editing
3. Merge changes? 
4. Remote configuration
5. Release script for putting on public host.
6. UI revamp + editing toolbar
    - headers
    - ital and bold
    - lists (unordered and numbered)
        - if nesting, alternate bullet items (*-+)
    - blockquotes
    - horizontal rules
    - links
    - images? 
7. Annotation system
    1. separate file storage?
    2. annotation is a range of text, an author, a timestamp, and an MD-formatted string
    3. rendering of annotations
    4. creation/deletion of annotations, push with rest of file
    5. annotation file has git hash of parent file, knows if it's out of sync
       - tries to correct if it can, based on range of annotation: 
         1. if it's been deleted, annotation goes with it
         2. if there have been additions or deletions before it, modify as needed
8. Image uploading
9. Frontmatter parsing into options? 
10. Offline mode
