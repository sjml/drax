# TODO

## Dev
* use actual button styling/logic instead of reproducing it?
    * enable/disable

## UI
* flash messages (successful save / unsuccessful save / file changed / etc.)
* let you choose different branches
* icon for repos (and chevron at right)
* fix layout of long directory names (consider tooltip for long names in general?)
  * once we're doing tooltips, show description of repos?
* check with rotated monitor how continuations go

## Bugs
* set up a lock so onScroll response can't get double-called
* wrapped formatting across multiple paragraphs breaks

## Polish
* update to use proper GraphQL variables instead of replacing
* surface an error somehow if authorization status is not 'OK'
* make auth URL a configurable parameter (4201)
* give back nothing from graphql query if we're not logged in

## Offline Mode
* cache docs in local storage until they're pushed? 
* recognize when GitHub is unreachable and just let us access the cache
* need to store repository info too... ðŸ˜¬

## Configuration
* hide dotfiles
* only show markdown files?
  * `.markdown`
  * `.mdown`
  * `.mkdn`
  * `.md`
  * `.mkd`
  * `.mdwn`
  * `.mdtxt`
  * `.mdtext`
  * `.text`
  * `.txt`
  * `.Rmd`

## Features
1. Detect if file in repo has changed since we started editing
2. Merge changes? 
3. Remote configuration
4. Release script for putting on public host.
5. UI revamp + editing toolbar
    - lists (unordered and numbered)
        - if nesting, alternate bullet items (*-+)
    - blockquotes
    - horizontal rules
    - links
    - images? 
6. Annotation system
    1. separate file storage?
    2. annotation is a range of text, an author, a timestamp, and an MD-formatted string
    3. rendering of annotations
    4. creation/deletion of annotations, push with rest of file
    5. annotation file has git hash of parent file, knows if it's out of sync
       - tries to correct if it can, based on range of annotation: 
         1. if it's been deleted, annotation goes with it
         2. if there have been additions or deletions before it, modify as needed
7. Image uploading
8. Frontmatter parsing into options? 
9. Offline mode
