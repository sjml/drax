# TODO

## UI
* fix layout of long directory names (consider tooltip for long names in general?)
  * once we're doing tooltips, show description of repos?
* check with rotated monitor how continuations go
* ugh, the icon layering is a pain; maybe upgrade to FA5 to use the SVG stuff

## Bugs
* if there's a stored bearerToken that is no longer valid, the login prompt will hang
* some weirdness on reload if a repo in the list no longer exists
* navlist gets screwy on logout
* annotation lines get screwy when view gets widened and sidebar locks in
* set up a lock so onScroll response can't get double-called
* chevrons can get out of alignment on long names (isbw-python-widget is example)

## Polish
* sidebar link is off-center on Chrome
* ability to toggle off links?
* Look into whether it makes sense to toggle comments back on if they were on before we switched away and back (per-file mode, persistent storage? )
* store docs so undo history is preserved across navigation
* update to use proper GraphQL variables instead of replacing
    - also unify formatting of all the various queries
* surface an error if authorization status is not 'OK'
* use getenv('variable_name') as option when constructing secrets in PHP
    - conditional include of secrets file, pull from env if not there, show error
* add server config files to dist: https://angular.io/guide/deployment#routed-apps-must-fallback-to-indexhtml

## Offline Mode
* cache docs in local storage until they're pushed? 
* recognize when GitHub is unreachable and just let us access the cache
* need to store repository info too... ðŸ˜¬
