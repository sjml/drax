# This is Markdown

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) lets you
write content in a really natural way.

**Bold**, _italic_, and ~~strikethrough~~.

* You can have lists, like this one
* Make things **bold** or *italic*
* Embed snippets of `code`
* Create [links](/)

1. Numbered lists, too!
2. Yep!

You can also make `monospaced sections`.
