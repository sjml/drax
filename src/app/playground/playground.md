# Drax Editor Playground

Hello! Welcome to Drax. This is an example of what the editor looks like. 

None of your changes here will be saved, and if you reload the page, this original text will be right back again. Just like in _Groundhog Day_! 🐿☀️ (Oh yes, you can use emoji. Do not abuse this privilege.)

The three buttons on the left of the toolbar are very important, but they're disabled for this demonstration because they only make sense when you're actually editing a file on GitHub. 

Everything else in the editor should work as you expect. You can make text **bold**, or _italicized_, or ~~cross it out~~. You can [make links to popular websites](https://google.com) if you want to. 

> This block of text will be set aside as a blockquote, which usually gives it some kind of special formatting. 

Play with all the formatting options to see what they do!

## Here is a level 2 header
### And here is level 3
#### Level 4

You may notice down here that some of this text has different color highlighting. That's because there are _annotations_ attached to this file. Click the "Toggle Comments" button at the far right to see them. 

You can also add your own annotations, using the button right next to it. Give it a try!
