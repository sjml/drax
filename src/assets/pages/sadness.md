It gives me no pleasure to say it, but the Drax editor doesn't work on mobile right now. I could let you see it, but it would be super janky and you would just be frustrated.

It would be great to have it work on mobile some day, but it's more effort than I have bandwidth for right now. Check it out on a computer!
